# Publication-Ready Figure Generation in R

This repository contains the materials for the course "Publication-Ready Figure Generation in R".

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand the principles of effective data visualization:**
  - Explain the importance of clarity, accuracy, and aesthetics in creating publication-ready figures.
  - Identify common pitfalls in data visualization and how to avoid them.
- **Use base R graphics for figure creation:**
  - Create basic plots (e.g., scatterplots, bar charts, histograms) using base R functions like `plot()`, `barplot()`, and `hist()`.
  - Customize plots with titles, labels, legends, and color schemes.
- **Master ggplot2 for advanced visualizations:**
  - Build complex and layered visualizations using the `ggplot2` package.
  - Apply themes, scales, and `geoms` to create polished and publication-ready figures.
- **Customize figures for specific publication requirements:**
  - Adjust figure dimensions, resolutions, and formats (e.g., PDF, PNG, TIFF) for journal submissions.
  - Modify fonts, line weights, and other stylistic elements to meet publication guidelines.
- **Incorporate statistical annotations and summaries:**
  - Add statistical summaries (e.g., regression lines, confidence intervals) to figures.
  - Annotate plots with p-values, correlation coefficients, or other relevant statistics.
- **Export high-quality figures:**
  - Use functions like `ggsave()` or `pdf()` to export figures in high resolution.
  - Ensure exported figures meet the technical requirements of target journals or platforms.
- **Create multi-panel figures:**
  - Combine multiple plots into a single figure using tools like `patchwork`.
  - Align and arrange subplots to effectively communicate complex data.
- **Follow best practices for reproducibility:**
  - Write clean and reusable R scripts for figure generation.
  - Document code and workflows to ensure reproducibility and transparency.

## Prerequisites

- **Basic R Programming Skills:**
  - Understanding R syntax (objects, functions, operators).
  - Ability to create and manipulate basic data structures: vectors, factors, data frames, and lists.
  - Familiarity with indexing and subsetting data.
  - Writing simple scripts in RStudio or another R IDE.
  - Reading and importing data (`read.csv()`, `read.table()`, or `readr`).
