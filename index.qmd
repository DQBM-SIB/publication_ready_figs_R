## Learning Objectives

- **Analyze the principles of effective data visualization:**
  - **Explain** the importance of clarity, accuracy, and aesthetics in creating publication-ready figures.
  - **Identify** common pitfalls in data visualization and how to avoid them.
- **Apply base R graphics for figure creation:**
  - **Create** basic plots (e.g., scatterplots, bar charts, histograms) using base R functions like `plot()`, `barplot()`, and `hist()`.
  - **Customize** plots with titles, labels, legends, and color schemes.
- **Construct advanced visualizations using ggplot2:**
  - **Build** complex and layered visualizations using the `ggplot2` package.
  - **Apply** themes, scales, and `geoms` to create polished and publication-ready figures.
- **Adapt figures for specific publication requirements:**
  - **Adjust** figure dimensions, resolutions, and formats (e.g., PDF, PNG, TIFF) for journal submissions.
  - **Modify** fonts, line weights, and other stylistic elements to meet publication guidelines.
- **Integrate statistical annotations and summaries:**
  - **Add** statistical summaries (e.g., regression lines, confidence intervals) to figures.
  - **Annotate** plots with p-values, correlation coefficients, or other relevant statistics.
- **Generate high-quality figures:**
  - **Use** functions like `ggsave()` or `pdf()` to export figures in high resolution.
  - **Ensure** exported figures meet the technical requirements of target journals or platforms.
- **Assemble multi-panel figures:**
  - **Combine** multiple plots into a single figure using tools like `patchwork`.
  - **Align** and **arrange** subplots to effectively communicate complex data.
- **Implement best practices for reproducibility:**
  - **Write** clean and reusable R scripts for figure generation.
  - **Document** code and workflows to ensure reproducibility and transparency.

## Learning experiences

To reach the learning outcomes we will use lectures, exercises, and polls. During exercises, you are free to discuss with other participants. During lectures, focus on the lecture only.

### Exercises

Each block has practical work involved. Some more than others. The practicals are subdivided into chapters, and weâ€™ll have a (short) discussion after each chapter. All answers to the practicals are incorporated, but they are hidden. Do the exercise first by yourself, before checking out the answer. If your answer is different from the answer in the practicals, try to figure out why they are different.
