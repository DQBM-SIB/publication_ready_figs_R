## Learning Objectives

### Block 1: Introduction to Data Visualization

- **Analyze the principles of effective data visualization:**
  - **Explain** the importance of clarity, accuracy, and aesthetics in creating publication-ready figures.
  - **Identify** common pitfalls in data visualization and how to avoid them.
- **Apply base R graphics for figure creation:**
  - **Create** basic plots (e.g., scatterplots, bar charts) using base R functions.
  - **Customize** plots with titles, labels, and legends.

### Block 2 & 3: Mastering `ggplot2`

- **Construct advanced visualizations using ggplot2:**
  - **Build** complex and layered visualizations using the `ggplot2` package.
  - **Develop** and **apply** custom themes for consistent styling across multiple plots.

### Block 4: Statistical Annotations

- **Integrate statistical annotations and summaries:**
  - **Add** statistical summaries (e.g., regression lines, confidence intervals) to figures.
  - **Annotate** plots with p-values and correlation coefficients.

### Block 5: Composition of Figures and Tables

- **Assemble complex figures from multiple components:**
  - **Construct** and **style** publication-ready tables using the `gt` package.
  - **Combine** multiple `ggplot2` plots, and `gt` tables, into a single, cohesive layout using `patchwork`.

### Block 6: Complex Heatmaps and Cross-System Plot Composition

- **Create and combine figures from different graphics systems:**
  - **Construct** complex, annotated heatmaps using the `ComplexHeatmap` package.
  - **Combine** plots from different systems (e.g., `ComplexHeatmap` and `ggplot2`) into a cohesive figure using `grid` graphics.

### Block 7: Finalizing Figures & Reproducibility

- **Produce and export publication-quality figures:**
  - **Adapt** stylistic elements like fonts and line weights to meet publication guidelines.
  - **Generate** high-resolution figures in various formats (PDF, PNG, TIFF) using functions like `ggsave()`.
- **Implement best practices for reproducibility:**
  - **Write** clean and reusable R scripts for figure generation.
  - **Document** code and workflows to ensure reproducibility and transparency.

## Learning experiences

To reach the learning outcomes we will use lectures, exercises, and polls. During exercises, you are free to discuss with other participants. During lectures, focus on the lecture only.

### Exercises

Each block has practical work involved. Some more than others. The practicals are subdivided into chapters, and we’ll have a (short) discussion after each chapter. All answers to the practicals are incorporated, but they are hidden. Do the exercise first by yourself, before checking out the answer. If your answer is different from the answer in the practicals, try to figure out why they are different.
